.26 = est motion not v good
going to increase the # neighbors to avoid overfitting
NumNeighbors 10 - up to 11 seconds prediction
made it MUCH less accurate woah
hopefully this will help the model for classification
cross validation?
try crossval(model)

decreased numneighbors down to 2 again
lowered the threshold to 5, so it would predict more motion and do it in smoother chunks
increased numcols to 500
decreased alpha to 0.9


figure out why there is that big drop at the end, maybe it is ruining the correlation
but higher k value is supposed to reduce overfitting!!! IDK
est_motions has MUCH less correlation
well i could filter that?
trying 20 knn now
doesn't seem to take drastically longer? and should def reduce overfitting
